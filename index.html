                <aside class="notes">
                    Every "real-world" application has some kind of logging infrastructure.
                    Sometimes it's quick and simple (error_log), sometimes it's more sophisticated and configurable (Monolog).

                    Unfortunately, many applications use logging inconsistently. The logging infrastructure is usually
                    grown organically and not thought through. Logging isn't usually the most loved and fun aspect of the development.
                    Lots of us log blindly and without thinking of who will read these logs and why.

                    In this talk, we will take some time to talk about logging in large applications.
                    Log exploitation (with tools such as ELK stacks/Graylog/… ) will not be addressed.

                <h2>Definition: <em>to log</em></h2>

                <blockquote>
                    “to make an official record of things that happen”
                </blockquote>

                <aside class="notes">
                    First of all, let's define what we talk about when we say "logs".

                    As we see in this definition, logs can be almost anything. Any event that is relevant
                    to explain the behavior of an application can be "logged" or saved somewhere for later
                    use.

                    What that tells us is that our logs might have different purposes and we have to take
                    that into account when we design our logging strategy.

            <section>
                <h2>Logging strategies</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>performance and resources</li>
                    <li class="fragment">errors</li>
                    <li class="fragment">user actions</li>
                </ul>

                <aside class="notes">
                    I think that logs can serve different purposes. The most common being:

                    * performance and resources: memory consumption, CPU/IO/network usage, external API calls and their response times, … Helps to monitor, debug and improve the general performance of the system.
                    * errors: exceptions, warnings, unexpected responses, … Helps detecting and troubleshooting issues with the system or its environment.
                    * user actions: actions performed by your users. Useful to help users when they come across an issue.
                    * business events: some log entries can be transformed into business-related metrics and statistics. Can be used as a poor man’s BI tool.

                    Therefore, the first step to write useful logs is to determine what they will be used for and by who.

                <h2>Log, log, log!</h2>

                <p>
                    Ensure that all the <strong>relevant events</strong> are logged!
                </p>

                <p class="fragment">
                    … relevant for who and why?</span>

                <aside class="notes">
                    In terms of logging strategy, we (TEA) are mainly interested by user actions of the platform and
                    potential errors.

                    For our needs, relevant events include business/user events such as
                    orders, refunds, API response times, errors, books integrations, …

                    To help you decide if something is worth logging or not, ask yourself
                    the following question: why logging this would be useful? to whom?

                    Exercise: ask yourself "what does my application log?"
                    Spoiler: if you want to answer by "everything", you have a problem.

Order<span class="fragment inserts" data-fragment-index="0"> "<mark>REF-42</mark>"</span> failed<span class="fragment inserts" data-fragment-index="0">: <mark>payment gateway unreachable</mark></span>.
                </code></pre>

                <aside class="notes">
                    Write sentences describing the event and including the relevant details.
                    Think about the person who will read the log.

                    An order failed? Which one? Why? When?

                    The first version is almost useless as it provides no information
                    that can be used to explain what happened and what action should be taken.

                    When a developer writes a log, he has in mind the context (in terms of code
                    and application flow) in which the log is to be inserted. We often tend to
                    write log messages that rely on this context… that is NOT present anymore when
                    the log entry is read.

                    To avoid having cryptic logs emitted by the application, log messages have to
                    be the most explicit possible.

                <aside class="notes">
                    The "when" question wasn't answered by the last log entry.
                    Timestamps help us correlate logs with other events (was there
                    a global outage in our banking service at that time?)

                    That's why we include dates in our log entries.

                    But there is still an issue here: the date format is ambiguous!

                    In order to avoid ambiguities, we will only use standard formats (ISO 8601 for instance)
                    and we will always indicate the date as first information of the log entries (for consistency).

                    Let the tool used for logs exploitation decide if its better to interpolate these
                    placeholders or not.
                    Also, for some languages string concatenation can be relatively expensive. Especially
                    if there are a lot of logs.

                    For error reporting tools (sentry, airbrake, …), non interpolated logs will be easier
                    to aggregate and to parse.

                    If you use things like logstash, the only way to extract the order ref and reason is by using
                    regex: it's slow (and can be complex, depending on the log entry to parse).

                    For this, a UUID is fine. The earlier it is generated, the better.

                    I often include two sets of metadata in my log entries:
                    * the first represents a log context and is associated to the event itself ;
                    * the other represents extra metadata automatically added to any event emitted by the application.
