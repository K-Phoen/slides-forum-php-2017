                <aside class="notes">
                    Every "real-world" application has some kind of logging infrastructure.
                    Sometimes it's quick and simple (error_log), sometimes it's more sophisticated and configurable (Monolog).

                    Unfortunately, many applications use logging inconsistently. The logging infrastructure is usually
                    grown organically and not thought through. Logging isn't usually the most loved and fun aspect of the development.

                    In this talk, we will take some time to talk about logging in large applications.
                    Log exploitation (with tools such as ELK stacks/Graylog/Kafka/… ) will not be addressed.

                <h2>Definition</h2>

                <blockquote>
                    “Detailed list of an application information, system performance, or user activities.”
                </blockquote>

                <aside class="notes">
                    First of all, let's define what we talk about when we say "logs".

                    As we see in this definition, logs can be almost anything. Any event that is relevant
                    to explain the behavior of an application can be "logged" or saved somewhere for later
                    use.

                    What that tells us is that our logs might have different purposes and we have to take
                    that into account when we design our logging strategy.

            <section>
                <h2>Logging strategies</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>performance and resources</li>
                    <li class="fragment">errors</li>
                    <li class="fragment">user actions</li>
                </ul>

                <aside class="notes">
                    I think that logs can serve different purposes. The most common being:

                    * performance and resources: memory consumption, CPU/IO/network usage, external API calls and their response times, … Helps to monitor, debug and improve the general performance of the system.
                    * errors: exceptions, warnings, unexpected responses, … Helps detecting and troubleshooting issues with the system or its environment.
                    * user actions: actions performed by your users. Useful to help users when they come across an issue.
                    * business metrics: business-related events. Can be used as a poor man’s BI tool.

                    Therefore, the first step to write useful logs is to determine what they will be used for and by who.

                <p>
                    Be sure that all the relevant events are logged

                <aside class="notes">
                    Once your logging strategy is identified, be sure that all the relevant events are logged.
